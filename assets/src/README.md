# React Source Files

This is where our React source files live.

## Things to note

* [`index.jsx`](index.jsx) is only used by Webpack dev server. Otherwise, is useless on remote servers.
* The other 2 files in the root of this directory are Webpack entry points. These files are the starting point for our React apps.
* The `common` folder is where shared, custom components should live.
* The `data` folder is where React contexts live.
