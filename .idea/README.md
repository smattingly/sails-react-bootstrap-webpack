# .idea Folder

This folder is to help configure [JetBrains IDE's](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It really only contains dictionaries (to help with spelling),
and run configurations, to make certain tasks, like lifting Sails, or starting Webpack dev server, a one-click operation. 

## If you are not using a JetBrains IDE...

Then you do not need this folder, and can safely delete it.
